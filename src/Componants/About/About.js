I have been working on web design and web development for the last one year and I have accumulated great experiences while working in this sector. I am currently learning more new programming technology. I have been working for a long time with great success on how to handle projects with clients, leadership skills, communication skills and several other skills. As the days go by, new technologies are with those new technologies, but the web development profession is above all my preference.</p>
